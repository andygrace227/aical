# Natural Language Calendar

This is a calendar application that allows you to schedule your day through natural language as the primary interface... like a secretary or executive assistant.

This is a beta version and it is currently hosted at [cal.andygrace.space](https://cal.andygrace.space)

## How do I use this tool?

- Find your calendar URL, and see if you can export the calendar as an ICS URL. If you use Gmail like I do, you can find a URL to your calendar within settings on the web app.
- Enter the ICS URL into the website.
- Interact with the AI assistant to schedule your day!

## What does this app do now?

**Not much.** It's currently read-only and the tentative events section does not work.

## What will come next?

- Tentative event editing.
- MCP used for getting the calendar and scheduling new events.
- MCP integrations for external services.
- Google Calendar integration.
